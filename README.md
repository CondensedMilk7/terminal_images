# terminal_images

> This module is WIP. Expect breaking changes.

**terminal_images** is a Deno module and CLI tool, written in TypeScript, for displaying images in the terminal.

Currently only PNG and JPG images are supported.

Run
```shell
deno run --allow-read --unstable https://deno.land/x/terminal_images/cli.ts --file="./path/to/image.jpg"
```
to see a basic demo.

| Property | Type | Description | Default Value | CLI Flag |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| `path` | string | The path or URL of the image. | No default | `--file` or `-f` |
| `color` | boolean | Whether to use colored pixel blocks (â–ˆ) for the output. If set to `true`, this will override the character map. | `false` | `--color` or `-c` |
| `characterMap` | string \| string[] | See the section on character maps for more information. | `"â–ˆâ–“â–’â–‘ "` | `--character-map` or `-m` |
| `inverted` | boolean | Whether the character map should be mapped from light to dark instead of dark to light. Set it to true if your terminal is in dark mode.  | `false` | `--inverted` or `-i` |
| `width` | number | The number of characters wide the image should be. | The maximum value where all of the image is visible at once | `--width` or `w` |


## Todo

- [X] Add some color ðŸŒˆ
- [ ] Add some tests
- [ ] Add some example output images
- [ ] Add some example character maps
- [ ] Finish documentation for the user in README.md
- [ ] Add jsdoc documentation in the code
- [X] Publish to nest.land
- [X] Add support for using images loaded from the web (rather than just locally)
- [X] Auto-detect file format (no need to rely on the file extension)
- [ ] Add support for webp images
- [ ] Add support for GIF images
- [X] Allow the user to input an array of strings for the character map [added, but user can't do this when using the cli]
- [ ] Way to get higher resolution outputs for color mode?
- [ ] Better error handling (e.g. 404 when fetching image)
- [ ] Add proper support for emojis and other characters that don't have length 1 in JavaScript
