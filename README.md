# terminal_images

> This module is WIP. Expect breaking changes.

**terminal_images** is a Deno module and CLI tool, written in TypeScript, for displaying images in the terminal.

Currently only PNG and JPG images are supported.

Run
```shell
deno run --allow-read --unstable https://deno.land/x/terminal_images/cli.ts --file="./path/to/image.jpg"
```
to see a basic demo.

## Todo

- [ ] Add some color! ðŸŒˆ
- [ ] Add some tests.
- [ ] Add some example images and example character maps.
- [ ] Add documentation (shouldn't need to be too much)
